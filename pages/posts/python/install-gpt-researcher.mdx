NBA Playoff picture: Updated standings, bracket, key dates for 2022-23 season
The 2023 NBA Playoff picture is coming into focus.
In the Eastern Conference, the playoff and Play-In Tournament matchups have been finalized. The Bucks, Celtics, 76ers, Cavaliers, Knicks and Nets are heading to the first round, while the Heat, Hawks, Raptors and Bulls will battle for the last two playoff berths.
There are still a few questions when it comes to seedings in the Western Conference. The Nuggets, Grizzlies, Kings and Suns will enter the bracket as the top four seeds, but the teams below them in the standings have not yet settled into their postseason slots.

Who will win the 2023 NBA Finals? Updated futures betting odds, predictions, expert picks & sleepers for NBA championship
The 2022 NBA season tips off Tuesday, October 18, launching what should be the most heavily-bet pro basketball campaign ever. Sports betting is now legal in 34 states in addition to Washington D.C., while the NBA continues to rise in popularity each year. You may not be quite ready to bet on individual games just yet, as many things can change between now and the regular-season opener. But now is a perfect time to get your futures bets in, especially for 2022-23 NBA Finals champion.

Title: 
Content: Of course, countless GMs — and pundits, analysts, writers, and talking heads — get their Finals picks wrong each year. The eventual NBA Finals champs could easily be outside the list of favorites as of right now, as we have seen so often in recent history.
Let's take a look at Caesars Sportsbook's full odds board for the 2023 NBA Finals, and then discuss the contenders before ultimately making our picks.
2023 NBA Finals Odds
2023 NBA Finals: A wide-open race?
We already talked about the core five favorites, and will discuss them more shortly. Outside the top five, the Suns (+1300) always lurk as a contender and have been to the Finals within the past two years. The 76ers (+1400) got better this offseason, and a full year of healthy Joel Embiid and James Harden could destroy the NBA. The Nuggets (+1600) also improved, putting much-needed shooting and depth around back-to-back MVP Nikola Jokic.

Content: 2023 NBA Finals predictions
Reiter's pick: Nuggets in 5. The Heat have shown grit, togetherness, resilience and a depth of talent that should teach us by now not to doubt them. But we're going to make that mistake one more time. Unlike the Boston Celtics team Miami bested, Denver will not play with its food and wait to be in a real hole before trying to fight its way out. They are, to say the least, much better coached. Nikola Jokic may be the game's best player, Jamal Murray is a star in his own right. And Denver's depth shouldn't be overlooked. Miami's had a magical, well-earned run. But it comes to an end against a much better Nuggets team. MVP: Nikola Jokic

NBA Finals predictions: Nuggets vs. Heat expert picks for NBA championship
No one could have predicted the Denver Nuggets and Miami Heat would be the last two teams standing in the 2023 NBA Finals when the playoffs began. Denver and Miami came from opposite ends of the bracket — the Nuggets as the No. 1 seed in the West, the Heat as the No. 8 and final seed in the East — but arrive in the championship round because of inspiring team-efforts that stunned their critics and cemented the mental and physical toughness of both rosters.

The 2023 NBA Finals matchup is set, and for just the second time in history it will include a No. 8 seed. That would be the Miami Heat, who avoided becoming the first team in history to blow a 3-0 series lead with a Game 7 victory over the Celtics to close the Eastern Conference finals on Monday night. Miami will face the the Denver Nuggets, the West's No. 1 seed who will have had more than a week of rest by the time Game 1 arrives Thursday.

NBA Finals
The NBA Finals is the annual championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Eastern and Western Conference champions play a best-of-seven series to determine the league champion. The team that wins the series is awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy, which replaced the original Walter A. Brown Trophy in 1976–77, though under the same name until 1984.
The series was initially known as the BAA Finals prior to the 1949–50 season when the Basketball Association of America (BAA) merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the NBA. The competition oversaw further name changes to NBA World Championship Series from 1950 to 1985, as well as a brief stint as the Showdown, before settling on NBA Finals in 1986.[1] Since 2018, it has been officially known as the NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV for sponsorship reasons.[2][3]

The team with the better regular season record hosts the first two games and the other team hosts the next two games.
